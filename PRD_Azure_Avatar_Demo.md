# Product Requirements Document: Azure Avatar Demo Application

## Project Overview
A demonstration application showcasing Azure Avatar technology integrated with a chatbot interface, utilizing multiple MCP (Model Context Protocol) services for enhanced information retrieval capabilities.

## Objectives
- Demonstrate Azure Avatar's text-to-speech capabilities with visual avatar representation
- Create an interactive chatbot experience with real-time information retrieval
- Showcase integration of multiple MCP services for comprehensive search functionality

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend
- **Framework**: React
- **Key Features**:
  - Chat interface for user input
  - Azure Avatar display component
  - Real-time message display
  - Search results visualization

### Backend
- **Framework**: Express.js
- **Key Features**:
  - Azure Speech Services integration
  - MCP service orchestration
  - WebSocket support for real-time communication
  - API endpoints for chat and search functionality

### External Services
1. **Azure Speech Services**
   - Text-to-Speech with Avatar
   - Region: Southeast Asia
   - Authentication via provided API key

2. **MCP Services**:
   - **Brave Search MCP**: Web search capabilities
   - **Context7 MCP**: Library documentation retrieval
   - **Firecrawl MCP**: Web scraping and content extraction

## Core Features

### 1. Chat Interface
- Text input field for user queries
- Message history display
- Typing indicators
- Clear conversation option

### 2. Azure Avatar Integration
- Visual avatar representation
- Synchronized lip-sync with speech
- Customizable avatar appearance
- Speech playback controls

### 3. Information Retrieval
- **Web Search**: General queries via Brave Search
- **Documentation Search**: Technical documentation via Context7
- **Content Extraction**: Detailed page content via Firecrawl
- Intelligent routing based on query type

### 4. Response Generation
- Natural language processing of search results
- Context-aware responses
- Avatar speech synthesis of responses

## User Flow
1. User enters a query in the chat interface
2. Backend processes the query and determines appropriate MCP service(s)
3. MCP services retrieve relevant information
4. Backend synthesizes a response based on retrieved data
5. Response is sent to Azure Avatar for speech synthesis
6. Avatar delivers the response with synchronized visual representation
7. User sees both text and avatar response

## API Endpoints

### Backend API
- `POST /api/chat` - Process user messages
- `GET /api/avatar/token` - Retrieve Azure Avatar authentication token
- `POST /api/search` - Execute search queries
- `GET /api/health` - Service health check

## Configuration Requirements
- Azure Speech Service credentials (provided)
- MCP service configurations
- CORS settings for frontend-backend communication
- WebSocket configuration for real-time updates

## Security Considerations
- Secure storage of Azure API keys
- Rate limiting on API endpoints
- Input validation and sanitization
- HTTPS enforcement in production
